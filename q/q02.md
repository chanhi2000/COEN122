## 1.
We wish to add a new instruction `sltm` (set on less than memory) to the single cycle datapath and control. Add any necessary datapaths and control signals to the attached figure. This new instruction `sltm $1, $2, $3` writes register 1, *i.e.*,
$$
\begin{cases}
$1=1,&\text{if }$2<mem[$3]\\
$1=0,&\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
The instruction has the following layout:


## 2.
Will the new instruction in question 1 change the cycle time assuming the delays as follows: 
- I-memory: $$2\:\text{ns}$$; 
- D-memory: $$2\:\text{ns}$$; 
- ALU and Adder: $$2\:\text{ns}$$; 
- register file: $$1.5\:\text{ns}$$; 
- other components: $$0\:\text{ns}$$;

Why or why not?


## 3.
Given the following sequence of instructions, (1) determine the value of every field in registers MEM/WB, EX/MEM, ID/EX in the beginning of cycle 5 in the  attached pipeline. Register MEM/WB contains information of instruction I1 and so on. Assume that before the instructions are executed, the state of the machine is as follows:  every register has initial value 220 plus the register number (e.g., register $8 has the initial value 228); every memory word accessed as data has the initial value 420 plus the byte address of the word (e.g., memory [8] has the initial value 428); the address of I1 is 800. The function code for and is 36.
